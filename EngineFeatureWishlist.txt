Here are the TripleA engine features that this map would benefit from:

1. Ability for a support unit to provide an additional first strike roll to the unit it's supporting
2. The ability for a script to count units and do a trigger that many times
3. Feature for the map to disable roll notifications are disabled by default
4. Directional terrain effects (between territories)
5. Various AI improvements. (Choosing starting territory, exploring beyond the home island, etc.)
